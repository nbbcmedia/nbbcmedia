# Channel Strips on the Mackie DL1608

## Overview
When you open the Master Fader app, the channel strips are the first thing you see. They take up the majority of the screen, and each one contains a number of controls available to you for each input. For the sake of simplifying this chapter, focus on only one channel strip at a time and start at the top. Imagine that for each input, its signal travels downward from the top of the strip to the bottom, and the signal is altered slightly along its journey by the different modifieres it encounters along the way.

### The Audio Signal's Journey
Obviously, the signal starts at the source. Whether that's a person's voice being spoken into a microphone, or a guitar sending an electrical impulse directly over a cable, the signal starts at the receiving device on the end of the cable farthest from you - Down on the stage!

Imagine the signal traveling through the cable, into the floor, up the walls, and into the mixer's input jack.<br>
From there, the signal continues into the board, and it encounters its first modifier (that we care about): EQ.

#### **EQ**
Ignore the faint horizontal green line. This is the signal's "trim" and we keep it at the default configuration here.
Moving on to the EQ box. This is where we shape the audio signal coming in through the input.

#### Dynamics
In the dynamics box, we're able to automate some volume adjustments. For example, imagine a signal suddenly gets too loud. Instead of manually reducing the volume, we can use the compressor to reduce the volume automatically if a loud condition is present.

#### Pan
By sliding the pan control left or right, you're able to push that channel's output to one side of the room.

## Outputs
The Mackie DL1608 has a total of 8 outputs: 2 XLR, 6 TRS.
The 2 XLR outputs feed into the power amplifier (Crown XLS 202, rack mounted). The power amp feeds into the main speakers in the sanctuary.

The 6 TRS (Auxiliary) outputs feed into the infant nursery speaker and the GoStream mixer.
What's unique about these 6 auxiliar outputs is the fact that the mixer can control the volumes of each channel indepentendtly on each output.
For example, with this capability we can play background music over the main speakers at x volume, and through the GoStream output at y volume.
